# bevy_fmod_phonon

## Experimental warning:
Currently there are some major open issues so please don't use this for a serious project.

## Phonon?
Phonon is the name Valve uses internally for the Steam Audio library and shows up in this crate as well since it's easier to write.

## About
Bevy_fmod_phonon is a Bevy integration for the Steam Audio plugin for FMOD. This means that the Steam Audio effects are mostly handled by the FMOD plugin, and this crate just provides an easy way to supply the Steam Audio effects with geometry information from Bevy.

It is therefore assumed that the user is somewhat familiar with FMOD and in this case using it through bevy_fmod.
